I was inspired by this tweet by Kent C. Dodds to dig into React's setState a bit more:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Read this and you&#39;ll know more about `setState` than 90% of react developers: <a href="https://t.co/P9GTc8Hpss">https://t.co/P9GTc8Hpss</a></p>&mdash; Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds) <a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/995102323939557376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

Low and behold, I indeed find quite a bit I wasn't aware of. Here's a quick breakdown:

## 1. React may batch setState calls.

React does not promise that your setState() call will be excecuted immediately. setState calls may be batched, and so if you set values, and then immediately try to read those values, they may not be what you expect:

```javascript
this.setState({ myNumber: 1 })
console.log(this.state.myNumber) // 1

this.setState({ myNumber: 2 })
console.log(this.state.myNumber) // 2... or maybe 1!
```
